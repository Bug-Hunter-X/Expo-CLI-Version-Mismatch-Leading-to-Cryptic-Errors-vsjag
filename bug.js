This error typically occurs when there's a mismatch between the Expo CLI version and the version of Expo modules used in your project. It can manifest as various cryptic errors during development or build processes.  The root cause often lies in outdated or mismatched dependencies, particularly when you upgrade Expo CLI without properly updating your project's dependencies to maintain compatibility.  For example, you might encounter errors like `Invariant Violation: ...` or others related to React Native components or Expo modules.  This means the project's dependencies don't align with the current Expo CLI version resulting in conflicts and unexpected behavior.
